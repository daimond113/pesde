pesde is a package manager for the Luau programming language, supporting multiple runtimes including Roblox and Lune.
pesde has its own registry, however it can also use Wally, and Git repositories as package sources.
It has been designed with multiple targets in mind, namely Roblox, Lune, and Luau.

## Installation

pesde can be installed from GitHub Releases. You can find the latest
release [here](https://github.com/daimond113/pesde/releases). Once you have downloaded the binary,
run the following command to install it:

```sh
pesde self-install
```

Note that pesde manages its own versions, so you can update it by running the following command:

```sh
pesde self-upgrade
```

## Documentation

*Currently waiting on [this PR](https://github.com/daimond113/pesde/pull/3) to be merged.*

## Registry

The main pesde registry is hosted on [fly.io](https://fly.io). You can find it at https://registry.pesde.daimond113.com.

### Self-hosting

The registry tries to require no modifications to be self-hosted. Please refer to the [example .env file](https://github.com/daimond113/pesde/blob/0.5/registry/.env.example) for more information.

and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).
