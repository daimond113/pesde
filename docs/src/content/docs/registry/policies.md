## Contact Us

You can contact us at [pesde@daimond113.com](malto:pesde@daimond113.com).

## Permitted content

The pesde registry is a place for Luau packages. Examples of allowed content:

- Libraries
- Frameworks

Examples of disallowed content:

- Malicious code
- Illegal content

pesde is not responsible for the content of packages. If you believe a package
is breaking these requirements, please [contact us](#contact-us).

## Package removal

pesde does not support removing packages from the registry without a reason such
as security or complying with the law in order. In case a secret has been
published to the registry, it must be invalided. If you believe a package should
be removed, please [contact us](#contact-us). We will review your request and
take action if necessary.

If we find that a package is breaking the permitted content policy, we will
remove it from the registry without notice.

pesde reserves the right to remove any package from the registry at any time for
any or no reason, without notice.

## Package ownership

Packages are owned by scopes. The first person to publish to a scope owns it. If
you want to work as a team, the owner of the scope must send a pull request to
the index repository adding the members' user IDs to the scope's `scope.toml`
file.

## Scope squatting

Scope squatting is the act of creating a scope with the intent of preventing
others from using it. Scope squatting is not allowed. If you believe a scope is
being squatted, please [contact us](#contact-us). We will review your request
and take action if necessary.

## API Usage

The pesde registry has an API for searching packages, downloading, and
publishing them. Only non-malicious use is permitted. Malicious uses include:

- **Service Degradation**: this includes sending the registry an excessive
  amount of requests
- **Exploitation**: this includes trying to break security of the registry in
  order to gain unauthorized access to resources
- **Harmful content**: this includes publishing harmful (non-law compliant,
  purposefully insecure) content
