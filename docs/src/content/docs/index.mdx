pesde is a package manager for the Luau programming language.

## Why use pesde?

When you write code, you often want to use libraries or frameworks that others
have written. Manually downloading and managing these can be cumbersome.

These libraries or frameworks can be distributed as packages. You can then
easily install and use these packages using pesde. pesde will automatically
download and manage the packages, and their dependencies, for you.

## Multi-target support

Luau can run in a lot of different places, such as on [Roblox][roblox], or in
[Lune][lune].

pesde is designed to work with all of these runtimes. Packages can publish
multiple versions of themselves, each tailored to a specific runtime.
