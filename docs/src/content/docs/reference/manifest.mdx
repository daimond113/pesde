`pesde.toml` is the manifest file for a pesde package. It contains metadata about
the package and its dependencies.

## Top-level fields

```toml
name = "acme/package"
version = "1.2.3"
description = "A package that does foo and bar"
license = "MIT"
authors = ["John Doe <john.doe@acme.local> (https://acme.local)"]
repository = "https://github.com/acme/package"
```

### `name`

The name of the package. This is used to identify the package in the registry.

The name consists of a scope and a package name, separated by a slash (`/`). It
may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.

The first one to publish to a given scope gets to own it. If you want multiple
people to be able to publish to the same scope, you can send a pull request to
the [pesde-index GitHub repository](https://github.com/daimond113/pesde-index)
and add the GitHub user ID of the other person to the `owners` field of the
`scope.toml` file of the given scope. For more information, see
[policies](/registry/policies#package-ownership).

### `version`

The version of the package. This must be a valid [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
version, such as `1.2.3`.

### `description`

A short description of the package. This is displayed on the package page in the
registry.

### `license`

The license of the package. It is recommended to use a
[SPDX license identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/), such as `MIT` or
`Apache-2.0`.

### `authors`

A list of authors of the package. Each author is a string containing the name of
the author, optionally followed by an email address in angle brackets, and a
website URL in parentheses. For example:

```toml
authors = ["John Doe <john.doe@acme.local> (https://acme.local)"]
```

### `repository`

The URL of the repository where the package is hosted. This is displayed on the
package page in the registry.

### `private`

A boolean indicating whether the package is private. If set to `true`, the
package cannot be published to the registry.

### `includes`

List of top-level files and directories to include in the package when
publishing. Files not listed here will not be published.

```toml
includes = [
  "pesde.toml",
  "README.md",
  "LICENSE",
  "init.luau",
  "docs",
]
```

### `pesde_version`

The version of pesde to use within this project. The `pesde` CLI will look at
this field and run the correct version of pesde for this project.

### `workspace_members`

A list of globs containing the members of this workspace.

## `[target]`

The `[target]` section contains information about the target platform for the
package.

```toml
[target]
environment = "luau"
lib = "init.luau"
```

### `environment`

The target environment for the package. This can be one of the following:

- `luau`: Standalone Luau code that can be run using the `luau` CLI.
- `lune`: Luau code that requires the Lune runtime.
- `roblox`: Luau code that must be run in Roblox.
- `roblox_server`: Same as `roblox`, but only for server-side code.

### `lib`

**Allowed in:** `luau`, `lune`, `roblox`, `roblox_server`

The entry point of the library exported by the package. This file is what will
be required when the package is loaded using `require`.

### `bin`

**Allowed in:** `luau`, `lune`

The entry point of the binary exported by the package. This file is what will be
run when the package is executed as a binary.

### `build_files`

**Allowed in:** `roblox`, `roblox_server`

A list of files that should be synced to Roblox when the package is installed.

```toml
build_files = [
  "init.luau",
  "foo.luau",
]
```

These files are passed to [`roblox_sync_config_generator`](#roblox_sync_config_generator)
when the package is installed in order to generate the necessary configuration.

## `[scripts]`

The `[scripts]` section contains scripts that can be run using the `pesde run`
command. These scripts are run using [Lune](https://lune-org.github.io/docs).

```toml
[scripts]
build = "sripts/build.luau"
test = "scripts/test.luau"
```

There are also a few special scripts that are run in certain cases by pesde.

### `roblox_sync_config_generator`

This is responsible for generating adequate configuration files for Roblox
sync tools.

`process.args` will contain the directory containing the package, and the list
of files specified within the [`target.build_files`](#build_files) of the
package.

You can find template scripts inside the
[`pesde-scripts` repository](https://github.com/daimond113/pesde-scripts)
for various sync tools.

/>

### `sourcemap_generator`

This is responsible for generating source maps for packages that are installed.
This is required to get proper types support when using
[Wally dependencies](/guides/dependencies/#wally-dependencies).

The script will receive the path to the package directory as the first argument
through `process.args`.

## `[indices]`

The `[indices]` section contains a list of pesde indices where packages can be
installed from.

```toml
[indices]
default = "https://github.com/daimond113/pesde-index"
acme = "https://github.com/acme/pesde-index"
```

These can then be referenced in the [`dependencies`](#dependencies) of the
package. The `default` index is used if no index is specified.

```toml
[dependencies]
foo = { name = "acme/foo", version = "1.2.3", index = "acme" }
```

## `[wally_indices]`

The `[wally_indices]` section contains a list of Wally indices where packages
can be installed from. This is used for
[Wally dependencies](/guides/dependencies/#wally-dependencies).

```toml
[wally_indices]
default = "https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally-index"
acme = "https://github.com/acme/wally-index"
```

These can then be referenced in the [`dependencies`](#dependencies) of the
package. The `default` index is used if no index is specified.

```toml
[dependencies]
foo = { wally = "acme/foo", version = "1.2.3", index = "acme" }
```

## `[overrides]`

The `[overrides]` section contains a list of overrides for dependencies. This
allows you to replace certain dependencies with different versions or even
different packages.

```toml
[overrides]
"bar>baz" = { name = "acme/baz", version = "1.0.0" }
"foo>bar,baz>bar" = { name = "acme/bar", version = "2.0.0" }
```

The above example will replace the `baz` dependency of the `bar` package with
version `1.0.0`, and the `bar` and `baz` dependencies of the `foo` package with
version `2.0.0`.

Each key in the overrides table is a comma-separated list of package paths. The
path is a list of package names separated by `>`. For example, `foo>bar>baz`
refers to the `baz` dependency of the `bar` package, which is a dependency of
the `foo` package.

## `[patches]`

The `[patches]` section contains a list of patches for dependencies. This allows
you to modify the source code of dependencies.

```toml
[patches]
"acme/foo" = { "1.0.0 luau" = "patches/acme+foo-1.0.0+luau.patch" }
```

The above example will patch version `1.0.0` with the `luau` target of the
`acme/foo` package using the `patches/acme+foo-1.0.0+luau.patch` file.

Each key in the patches table is the package name, and the value is a table
where the keys are the version and target, and the value is the path to the
patch.

The patches can be generated using the `pesde patch` command.

## `[place]`

This is used in Roblox projects to specify where packages are located in the
Roblox datamodel.

```toml
[place]
shared = "game.ReplicatedStorage.Packages"
server = "game.ServerScriptService.Packages"
```

## `[dependencies]`

The `[dependencies]` section contains a list of dependencies for the package.

```toml
[dependencies]
foo = { name = "acme/foo", version = "1.2.3" }
bar = { wally = "acme/bar", version = "2.3.4" }
baz = { git = "acme/baz", rev = "main" }
```

Each key in the dependencies table is the name of the dependency, and the value
is a dependency specifier.

There are several types of dependency specifiers.

### pesde

```toml
[dependencies]
foo = { name = "acme/foo", version = "1.2.3", index = "acme", target = "lune" }
```

**pesde dependencies** contain the following fields:

- `name`: The name of the package.
- `version`: The version of the package.
- `index`: The [pesde index](#indices) to install the package from. If not
  specified, the `default` index is used.
- `target`: The target platform for the package. If not specified, the target
  platform of the current package is used.

### Wally

```toml
[dependencies]
foo = { wally = "acme/foo", version = "1.2.3", index = "acme" }
```

**Wally dependencies** contain the following fields:

- `wally`: The name of the package.
- `version`: The version of the package.
- `index`: The [Wally index](#wally_indices) to install the package from. If not
  specified, the `default` index is used.

### Git

```toml
[dependencies]
foo = { git = "acme/packages", rev = "main", path = "foo" }
```

**Git dependencies** contain the following fields:

- `git`: The URL of the Git repository.
  This can either be `<owner>/<name>` for a GitHub repository, or a full URL.
- `rev`: The Git revision to install. This can be a branch, tag, or commit hash.
- `path`: The path within the repository to install. If not specified, the root
  of the repository is used.

## `[peer_dependencies]`

The `[peer_dependencies]` section contains a list of peer dependencies for the
package. These are dependencies that are required by the package, but are not
installed automatically. Instead, they must be installed by the user of the
package.

```toml
[peer_dependencies]
foo = { name = "acme/foo", version = "1.2.3" }
```

## `[dev_dependencies]`

The `[dev_dependencies]` section contains a list of development dependencies for
the package. These are dependencies that are only required during development,
such as testing libraries or build tools. They are not installed when the
package is used by another package.

```toml
[dev_dependencies]
foo = { name = "acme/foo", version = "1.2.3" }
```
