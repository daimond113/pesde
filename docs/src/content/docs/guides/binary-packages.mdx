A **binary package** is a package that contains a binary export.

Binary packages can be run like a normal program. There are several ways to use
binary packages with pesde.

## Using `pesde x`

The `pesde x` command can be used to run a one-off binary package. This is
useful for running a binary package without installing it or outside of a pesde
project.

```sh
pesde x pesde/hello
# Hello, pesde! (pesde/hello@1.0.0, lune)
```

## Installing a binary package

Binary packages can be installed using the `pesde add` and `pesde install`
commands.

This requires a `pesde.toml` file to be present in the current directory, and
will add the binary package to the `dependencies` section of the file.

```sh
pesde add pesde/hello
pesde install
```

This will add the binary package to your `PATH`, meaning that it can be run
anywhere!

```sh
hello
# Hello, pesde! (pesde/hello@1.0.0, lune)
```
