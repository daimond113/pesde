Workspaces allow you to work with multiple pesde projects within a single
repository. Packages within a workspace can depend on each other. And you can
run commands like install or publish on every package in the workspace at once.

Let's say you have a repository with the following structure:

<FileTree>

- pesde.toml
- pkgs/
  - foo/
    - pesde.toml
    - ...
  - bar/
    - pesde.toml
    - ...

</FileTree>

Within the root `pesde.toml` file, we can define a workspace:

```toml title="pesde.toml"
name = "acme/root"
version = "0.0.0"
private = "true"

workspace_members = ["pkgs/*"]

[target]
environment = "luau"
```

Now, each folder within the `pkgs/` directory is considered a package in the
workspace. You can run commands like `pesde install` or `pesde publish` from
the root of the repository to run them on every package in the workspace.

## Workspace Dependencies

Packages within a workspace can depend on each other. For example, if `foo`
depends on `bar`, you can add a dependency to `bar` in the `foo/pesde.toml` file:

```toml title="pkgs/foo/pesde.toml"
name = "acme/foo"
version = "1.0.0"

[dependencies]
bar = { workspace = "acme/bar", version = "^"  }
```

Workspace dependencies are replaced with normal pesde dependencies when
publishing.

The `version` field can either contain `^`, `*`, `=`, `~`, or a specific version
requirement, such as `^1.0.0`. If you use `^`, `=`, or `~`, it will be replaced
with the version of the package in the workspace when publishing.

For example, if you had the following:

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[dependencies]
bar = { workspace = "acme/bar", version = "^" }
qux = { workspace = "acme/qux", version = "=" }
qar = { workspace = "acme/qar", version = "~" }
zoo = { workspace = "acme/zoo", version = "^2.1.0" }
baz = { workspace = "acme/baz", version = "*" }
```

If `bar`, `baz`, `qux`, `qar`, and `zoo` are all at version `2.1.5` in the
workspace, the `pesde.toml` file will be transformed into the following when
publishing.

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[dependencies]
bar = { name = "acme/bar", version = "^2.1.5" }
qux = { name = "acme/qux", version = "=2.1.5" }
qar = { name = "acme/qar", version = "~2.1.5" }
zoo = { name = "acme/zoo", version = "^2.1.0" }
baz = { name = "acme/baz", version = "*" }
```

A `target` field can be added to the `dependencies` table to specify a target
environment for the dependency.

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[dependencies]
bar = { workspace = "acme/bar", version = "^", target = "luau" }
```
