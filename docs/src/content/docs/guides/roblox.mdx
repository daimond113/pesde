description: Using pesde in a Roblox project.
---

pesde can be used in Roblox projects, however this requires some extra setup.
Namely, you need to specify a `roblox_sync_config_generator` script in order
to generate the adequate configuration for the sync tool you are using.

The [`pesde-scripts`](https://github.com/daimond113/pesde-scripts)
repository contains a list of scripts for different sync tools. If the tool
you are using is not supported, you can write your own script and submit a PR
to get it added.

These scripts are automatically cloned into the `~/.pesde/scripts` folder and
kept up to date when you use pesde.

## Usage with Rojo

[Rojo](https://rojo.space/) is a popular tool for syncing files into Roblox
Studio.

Running `pesde init` will prompt you to select a target, select
`roblox` or `roblox_server` in this case. This will setup the configuration
needed to use pesde in a project using Rojo.

## Usage with other tools

If you are using a different sync tool, you should look for it's scripts in the
pesde-scripts repository. If you cannot find them, you can write your own and
optionally submit a PR to help others using the same tool as you get started
quicker. 

Scaffold your project with `pesde init`, select the `roblox` or `roblox_server`
target, and then replace the `.pesde/roblox_sync_config_generator.luau` script
with the one you want to use.
