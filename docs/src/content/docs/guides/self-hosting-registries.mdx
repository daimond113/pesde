You can self host registries for pesde. This is useful if you want a private
registry or if you a separate registry for other reasons.

## Making the index repository

The index is a repository that contains metadata about all the packages in the
registry.

An index contains a `config.toml` file with configuration options.

To create an index, create a new repository and add a `config.toml` file with
the following content:

```toml title="config.toml"
# The URL of the registry API
api = "https://registry.acme.local/"

# Package download URL (optional)
download = "{API_URL}/v0/packages/{PACKAGE}/{PACKAGE_VERSION}/{PACKAGE_TARGET}"

# the client ID of the GitHub OAuth app (optional)
github_oauth_client_id = "a1d648966fdfbdcd9295"

# whether to allow packages with Git dependencies (default: false)
git_allowed = true

# whether to allow packages which depend on packages from other registries
# (default: false)
other_registries_allowed = true

# whether to allow packages with Wally dependencies (default: false)
wally_allowed = false

# the maximum size of the archive in bytes (default: 4MB)
max_archive_size = 4194304
```

- **api**: The URL of the registry API. See below for more information.

- **download**: The URL to download packages from. This is optional and
  defaults to the correct URL for the official pesde registry implementation.
  You only need this if you are using a custom registry implementation.

  This string can contain the following placeholders:

  - `{API_URL}`: The API URL (as specified in the `api` field).
  - `{PACKAGE}`: The package name.
  - `{PACKAGE_VERSION}`: The package version.
  - `{PACKAGE_TARGET}`: The package target.

  Defaults to `{API_URL}/v0/packages/{PACKAGE}/{PACKAGE_VERSION}/{PACKAGE_TARGET}`.

- **github_oauth_client_id**: This is required if you use GitHub OAuth for
  authentication. See below for more information.

- **git_allowed**: Whether to allow packages with Git dependencies. This is
  optional and defaults to `false`.

- **other_registries_allowed**: Whether to allow packages which depend on
  packages from other registries. This is optional and defaults to `false`.

- **wally_allowed**: Whether to allow packages with Wally dependencies. This is
  optional and defaults to `false`.

- **max_archive_size**: The maximum size of the archive in bytes. This is
  optional and defaults to `4194304` (4MB).

You should then push this repository to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Configuring the registry

The registry is a web server that provides package downloads and the ability to
publish packages.

The official registry implementation is available in the
[pesde GitHub repository](https://github.com/daimond113/pesde/tree/0.5/registry).

Configuring the registry is done using environment variables. In order to allow
the registry to access the index repository, you must use a personal access
token of a GitHub account that has access to the index repository. We recommend
using a separate GitHub account for this purpose.

For instructions on how to create a personal access token, see the
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
The access token must have read and write access to the index repository.

### General configuration

- **INDEX_REPO_URL**: The URL of the index repository. This is required.\
  Example: `https://github.com/daimond113/pesde-index.git`

- **GITHUB_USERNAME**: The username of the GitHub account that has access to the
  index repository. This is required.

- **GITHUB_PAT**: The personal access token of the GitHub account specified by
  `GITHUB_USERNAME`. This is required.

### Authentication configuration

The registry supports multiple authentication methods, which are documented
below.

#### General configuration

- **READ_NEEDS_AUTH**: If set to any value, reading data requires
  authentication. If not set, anyone can read from the registry.
  This is optional.

#### Single token authentication

Allows read and write access to the registry using a single token.

- **ACCESS_TOKEN**: The token to use for authentication.

#### Multiple token authentication

Allows read and write access to the registry using different tokens.

- **READ_ACCESS_TOKEN**: The token that grants read access.
- **WRITE_ACCESS_TOKEN**: The token that grants write access.

#### GitHub OAuth authentication

Allows clients to get read and write access to the registry using GitHub OAuth.
This requires a GitHub OAuth app, instructions to create one can be found
in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).

- **GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET**: The client secret of the GitHub OAuth app.

#### No authentication

If none of the above variables are set, **anyone** will be able to read and
write to the registry.

### Storage configuration

The registry supports multiple storage backends, which are documented below.

#### File system storage

Stores packages on the file system.

- **FS_STORAGE_ROOT**: The root directory where packages are stored.

#### S3 storage

Stores packages on an S3 compatible storage service, such as
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or
[Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/r2/).

- **S3_ENDPOINT**: The endpoint of the S3 bucket to store packages in.
- **S3_BUCKET_NAME**: The name of the bucket.
- **S3_REGION**: The region of the bucket.
- **S3_ACCESS_KEY**: The access key to use.
- **S3_SECRET_KEY**: The secret key to use.

### Sentry configuration

The registry supports [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error tracking.

- **SENTRY_URL**: The URL of the Sentry instance.

## Running the registry

First clone the repository and navigate to the repository directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/daimond113/pesde.git
cd pesde
```

You can then build the registry using the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release -p pesde-registry
```

This will build the registry. The resulting binary will be located at
`target/release/pesde-registry` or `target/release/pesde-registry.exe`.

After setting the environment variables, you can run the registry using the
by executing the binary.

The registry must be exposed at the URL specified in the `api` field of the
index repository configuration.
