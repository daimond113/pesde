The `[dependencies]` section of your `pesde.toml` file is where you specify the
dependencies of your project.

pesde supports multiple types of dependencies.

## pesde Dependencies

The most common type of dependency are pesde dependencies. These are
dependencies on packages published to a [pesde registry](https://pesde.daimond113.com).

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[indices]
default = "https://github.com/daimond113/pesde-index"

[dependencies]
hello = { name = "pesde/hello", version = "^1.0.0" }
```

In this example, we're specifying a dependency on the `pesde/hello` package on
the official pesde registry with a version constraint of `^1.0.0`.

You can also add a dependency by running the following command:

```sh
pesde add pesde/hello
```

## Git Dependencies

Git dependencies are dependencies on packages hosted on a Git repository.

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[dependencies]
acme = { repo = "acme/package", rev = "main" }
```

In this example, we're specifying a dependency on the package contained within
the `acme/package` GitHub repository at the `main` branch.

You can also use a URL to specify the Git repository and a specific commit.

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[dependencies]
acme = { repo = "https://git.acme.local/package.git", rev = "aeff6" }
```

You can also specify a path if the package is not at the root of the repository.

<FileTree>

- acme/package.git
  - pkgs/
    - **foo/**
      - pesde.toml
      - ...

</FileTree>

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[dependencies]
foo = { repo = "acme/package", rev = "main", path = "pkgs/foo" }
```

The path specified by the Git dependency must either be a valid pesde package or
a [Wally][wally] package.

You can also add a Git dependency by running the following command:

```sh
# From Git URL
pesde add https://git.acme.local/package.git#aeff6

# From GitHub repository
pesde add gh#acme/package#main
```

## Wally Dependencies

Wally dependencies are dependencies on packages published to a
[Wally registry][wally]. Wally is a package manager for Roblox and thus Wally
dependencies should only be used in Roblox projects.

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[wally_indices]
default = "https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally-index"

[dependencies]
foo = { wally = "acme/package", version = "^1.0.0" }
```

In this example, we're specifying a dependency on the `acme/package` package
on the official Wally registry with a version constraint of `^1.0.0`.

<Aside type="note">

In order to get proper types support for Wally dependencies, you need to have
a [`sourcemap_generator` script](/reference/manifest#sourcemap_generator)
specified in your `pesde.toml` file.

</Aside>

You can also add a Wally dependency by running the following command:

```sh
pesde add wally#acme/package
```

## Workspace Dependencies

Packages within a workspace can depend on each other. For example, if `foo`
and `bar` are both packages in the same workspace, you can add a dependency to
`bar` in the `foo/pesde.toml` file:

```toml title="foo/pesde.toml"
[dependencies]
bar = { workspace = "acme/bar", version = "^" }
```

You can also add a workspace dependency by running the following command:

```sh
pesde add workspace:acme/bar
```

## Peer Dependencies

Peer dependencies are dependencies that are not installed automatically when
used by another package. They need to be installed by the user of the package.

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[peer_dependencies]
foo = { name = "acme/foo", version = "^1.0.0" }
```

You can add a peer dependency by passing `--peer` to the `pesde add` command:

```sh
pesde add --peer acme/foo
```

## Dev Dependencies

Dev dependencies are dependencies that are only used during development. They
are not installed when the package is used as a dependency.

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[dev_dependencies]
foo = { name = "acme/foo", version = "^1.0.0" }
```

You can add a dev dependency by passing `--dev` to the `pesde add` command:

```sh
pesde add --dev acme/foo
```
