pesde has several ways to override or patch dependencies in your project.

## Dependency Overrides

Dependency overrides allow you to replace a dependency of a dependency with a
different version or package.

Let's say you have a project with the following dependencies:

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[dependencies]
foo = { name = "acme/foo", version = "^1.0.0" }
```

But `foo` depends on `bar` 1.0.0, and you want to use `bar` 2.0.0 instead. You
can override the `bar` dependency in your `pesde.toml` file:

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[dependencies]
foo = { name = "acme/foo", version = "^1.0.0" }

[overrides]
"foo>bar" = { name = "acme/bar", version = "^2.0.0" }
```

Now, when you run `pesde install`, `bar` 2.0.0 will be used instead of 1.0.0.

You can learn more about the syntax for dependency overrides in the
[reference](/reference/manifest#overrides).

## Patching Dependencies

Patching allows you to modify the source code of a dependency.

To patch a dependency, you can use the `pesde patch` and `pesde patch-commit`
commands.

Let's say you have the following dependency in your `pesde.toml` file:

```toml title="pesde.toml"
[target]
environment = "luau"

[dependencies]
foo = { name = "acme/foo", version = "^1.0.0" }
```

And you want to patch `foo` to fix a bug. You can run the following command:

```sh
pesde patch "acme/foo@1.0.0 luau"

# done! modify the files in the directory, then run `pesde patch-commit /x/y/z`
# to apply.
# warning: do not commit these changes
# note: the pesde.toml file will be ignored when patching
```

pesde will copy the source code of `foo` to a temporary directory, in this case
`/x/y/z`. You can then modify the files in this directory. Once you're done,
run `pesde patch-commit /x/y/z` to apply the changes.

This will create a patch within the `patches` directory of your project, and
add an entry to `[patches]`. Then, next time you run `pesde install`, the patch
will be applied to the dependency.

Make sure not to commit or stage the changes made in the temporary directory.
Otherwise pesde may not be able to create the patch correctly.
