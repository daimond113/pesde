## Configuration

Before you can publish a package, you must configure the required fields in your
`pesde.toml` file.

### `includes`

The `includes` field is a list of files and directories that should be included
in the package.

```toml
includes = [
  "pesde.toml",
  "README.md",
  "LICENSE",
  "init.luau",
]
```

### `target`

The `target` field defines the environment where the package can be run.

Here, you must also specify the `lib` and/or `bin` fields to indicate the path
of the exported library or binary.

```toml
[target]
environment = "luau"
lib = "init.luau"
```

#### Roblox

`bin` is not supported in Roblox packages. You must also specify a list of
`build_files`. These are the files that should be synced into Roblox. They are
passed to the `roblox_sync_config_generator` script.

For more information, see [Roblox](/guides/roblox).

```toml
[target]
environment = "roblox"
lib = "init.luau"
build_files = ["init.luau"]
```

## Authentication

Before you can publish a package, you must authenticate with your GitHub account.

```sh
pesde auth login
```

You will be given a code and prompted to open the GitHub authentication page in
your browser. You must enter the code to authenticate.

## Publishing

To publish a package, run the following command:

```sh
pesde publish
```

You will be prompted to confirm the package details before publishing.

Once a package is published, others will be able to install it. You may not
remove a package once it has been published. You may not publish a package with
an already existing version.

## Multi-target Packages

You may publish packages under the same name and version but with different
targets. This allows you to publish a package that can be used in multiple
environments.

For example, you may publish a package that can be used in both Roblox and
Luau environments by publishing two versions of the package, one for each
environment.

## Documentation

The `README.md` file in the root of the package will be displayed on the
[pesde registry website](https://pesde.daimond113.com/).

If you have a `docs` directory in the root of the package, they will be
hosted by pesde and be accessible on the pesde website.
