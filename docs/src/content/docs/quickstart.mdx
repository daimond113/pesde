Let's make a simple Luau program that uses the `pesde/hello` package to print
hello to the terminal.

## Scaffolding the project

In your terminal, run the following commands to create a folder and navigate
into it.

```sh
mkdir hello-pesde
cd hello-pesde
```

Then, we'll use `pesde init` to scaffold a new pesde project. The command will
ask you a few questions to set up the project. Our project will be named
`<username>/hello_pesde`, replace `<username>` with a username of your choice.
The name may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. The
environment we're targeting is `luau`.

```sh
pesde init

# What is the name of the project? <username>/hello_pesde
# What is the description of the project? (leave empty for none) 
# Who are the authors of this project? (leave empty for none, comma separated) 
# What is the repository URL of this project? (leave empty for none) 
# What is the license of this project? (leave empty for none) MIT
# What environment are you targeting for your package? luau
# Would you like to setup a default roblox_sync_config_generator script? No
```

The command will create a `pesde.toml` file in the current folder. Go ahead
and open this file in your text editor of choice.

## Adding a main script

Under the `[target]` section, we're going to add a `bin` field to specify
the path to the main script of our package.

```diff lang="toml" title="pesde.toml"
  name = "<username>/hello_pesde"
  version = "0.1.0"
  license = "MIT"

  [target]
  environment = "luau"
+ bin = "main.luau"

  [indices]
  default = "https://github.com/daimond113/pesde-index"
```

Don't forget to save the file after making the changes.

Now, lets create a `main.luau` file in the project folder and add the following
code to it.

```luau title="main.luau"
print("Hello, pesde!")
```

## Running the script

Then, we can run the following command to run the script.

```sh
pesde run
```

You should see `Hello, pesde!` printed to the terminal.

## Install a dependency

Let's use the `pesde/hello` package instead of printing ourselves.

Run the following command to add the package to `pesde.toml`.

```sh
pesde add pesde/hello
```

You should see that `pesde.toml` has been updated with the new dependency.

```diff lang="toml" title="pesde.toml"
  name = "lukadev_0/hello_pesde"
  version = "0.1.0"
  license = "MIT"

  [target]
  environment = "luau"
  bin = "main.luau"

  [indices]
  default = "https://github.com/daimond113/pesde-index"

+ [dependencies]
+ hello = { name = "pesde/hello", version = "^1.0.0" }
```

Run the following command to install the new dependency.

```sh
pesde install
```

You should see that pesde has created a `luau_packages` folder containing the
newly installed package. It has alsoo created a `pesde.lock` file, this file
contains the exact versions of the dependencies that were installed so that
they can be installed again in the future.

<FileTree>

- luau_packages/
  - hello.luau
  - ...
- main.luau
- pesde.lock
- pesde.toml

</FileTree>

Let's update the `main.luau` file to use the `pesde/hello` package.

```luau title="main.luau"
local hello = require("./luau_packages/hello")

hello()
```

If we run the script again, we should see something printed to the terminal.

```sh
pesde run
# Hello, pesde! (pesde/hello@1.0.0, luau)
```
